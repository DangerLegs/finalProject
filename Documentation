CSE 210 - Final Project. 


- This is an adventure style game featuring a protagonist and a main antagonist (decidedly a crocodile)
- Large map that has dangers(spikes, lava, pits, etc.) and possibly enemies (sprites) you need to avoid
- Map built using Tiled and game features created using the Arcade library for python. 
- Main character will mainly avoid obstacles and enemies (no fight back)
- Game will have an intro that describes the story/ motive for the protagonist
- We will try and include background music and definitely include sound bytes for things like jumping, falling, etc.
- At the end of this week we want:
    - A story line implemented 
    - Character animations
    - A win/ lose screen
    - Live counter
