Conor McShane,
I was born in Utah in the year 2000. I moved to Washington State
when I was 2 and that is where I lived most of my life. I have played
a lot of different sports in my life but swimming was my main sport.
Speaking of main, my main character for super smash bros. is 
Mr. Game and Watch. I play the piano with some intermediate skill.
